# Project Title

The Future of Finance - how AI will revolutionise stockpicking techniques
## Summary

As AI becomes more powerful, it will be able to collect far more data far quicker than any human analyst. This will alllow it to, without emotions, be able to optimise stock trading as better-informed programs make the best choice in a fraction of the time, and do not require a high salary.

## Background


* Currently, stock traders are paid a lot of money, including comission, for what they do
* They also are not always totally informed when buying stocks
* AI runs with no emotion, which can be very bad for human traders as it causes them to make poor decisions


## How is it used?

This is not a new concept - many firms have tried to implement AI into their analysis, with varying degrees of success. Overall, human analysts are better at their job than the computers are, but soon they will begin to catch up.
AI stockpickers could be rolled out for both highly lucrative and powerful hedgefunds and also lone day traders who are simply buying and selling shares as a hobby.
This would affect the financial sector profoundly - many many jobs would be lost as it makes far more sense to employ a program for free rather than pay lots of analysts millions in order to do the same job.


## Challenges

This would, naturally, encounter lots of pushback from analysts as it would be taking over their jobs. Also, by standardising the logic by which trades are made, AI could potentially render trading useless as all parties apply 
identical logic when buying and selling, and so no value could possibly be created. 
Another problem is overfitting. When millions or billions of dollars are on the line, it is imperative that the program works perfectly and does not suddenly diverge from the market position and cause the fund to buy or sell at 
ridiculous prices

## What next?

This project would have to be undertaken by very expert programmers as there is so much risk and also so much reward involved. It is relatively easy to make a simple program to predict the price of a stock, but it is very difficult
to create a program that reliably does not overfit the data and also remains very very precise. Also, as the technology improves, there would be potential to build into the program an understanding of how current affairs shape the 
financial landscape, and by connecting it to live news feeds make it able to predict market shocks and act accordingly to minimise losses.
